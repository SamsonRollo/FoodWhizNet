Knowing what you eat is the trend nowadays. May you be a traveler who wants to try novel and exotic foods, or some health-conscious individual trying to live healthily. Because nobody wants to ingest unknown or unhealthy foods. However, identifying which food is which is somewhat overwhelming, especially with the amount of food classes that exist. With the advent of Deep Learning Technology, identifying foods got a bit easier, but with the ever-increasing number of food classes, so has the complexity of identifying them. The aim to address this problem as well as the gaps in the literature, brought FoodWhizNet to light. Exploiting the spectral feature of food images to produce a robust and efficient means of food image classification by using multiple color spaces, such as LAB, HSV, XYZ, etc, as inputs to a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network. The preliminary experiments showed a promising result. The current proposed model achieved 80.07\% with the best model found earlier in the 10th epoch of model training.
