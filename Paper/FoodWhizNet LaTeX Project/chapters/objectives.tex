This section presents the objectives of the study.
\section{General Objective}
To deploy a functional web-based food classification system that utilize multiple color spaces extracted from an image as an input to a Siamese-CNN deep learning network.
\section{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop an alternative approach to food classification using multiple color spaces extracted from a food image.
    \item To conduct an ablation study on the best 2-color space input combination for the Siamese-CNN model.
    \item To compare the performance of the proposed model with the current state-of-the-art models in the food classification problem. 
    \item To implement a Siamese-CNN deep learning model on food classification using a web-based application.
\end{enumerate}
